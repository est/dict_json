  "ETYMOLOGY":"From French margarine, coined in 1813 by chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, referring to 'margaric acid' (mistakenly thought to be a distinct fatty acid, named from Greek márgāron 'pearl', referring to the pearly luster of the crystals). The name was later applied to the butter substitute developed by Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès in the 1860s.",
