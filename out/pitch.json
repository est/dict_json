  "CONJUGATES":"Verb: pitch | pitches | pitched | pitching | Noun: pitch | pitches",
  "ETYMOLOGY":"The word 'pitch' has two main etymological origins: \n1. For the viscous substance (tar): From Old English 'pic', which comes from Latin 'pix' (genitive 'picis').\n2. For the verb and other noun senses (to throw, sound, playing field, sales talk): From Old English 'pician' ('to prick, sting'), related to 'pike' (a pointed weapon). This root evolved to mean 'to thrust, set in position', then later 'to throw' or 'to present forcefully'. The musical sense relates to the 'point' or degree of highness/lowness of a tone.",
  "SINCE":"Tar sense: Before 1000 AD (Old English) | Other senses: c. 1200 AD (verb), c. 1500-1600s (noun senses)",
