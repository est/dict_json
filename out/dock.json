  "IPA":"/dɑk/",
  "CONJUGATES":"docks | docking | docked",
  "ETYMOLOGY":"For the meaning 'wharf or basin for ships', from Middle Dutch *docke* or Middle Low German *docke* (mid-16th century). For the meaning 'to cut short or deduct', perhaps from Old English *doccian* 'to dock, shorten', related to *docce* 'burdock' (mid-15th century). The meaning 'defendant's enclosure in court' possibly derives from the ship's dock sense, implying confinement (late 17th century). The noun referring to an animal's tail also dates back to the 15th century, with unclear origin but potentially related to the verb 'to cut short'.",
