  "ETYMOLOGY":"From Old French 'Pruse' (Prussia), from which 'spruce leather' was imported in the late 14th century. The adjective and verb meaning 'neat' developed in the mid-16th century, possibly from the association of neatness with Prussian goods or the trim appearance of the spruce tree. The noun for the tree itself appeared in the late 17th century, derived from 'spruce fir'.",
  "SINCE":"Late 14th century (referring to 'Prussian' origin); mid-16th century (as adjective/verb); late 17th century (as tree noun)",
