  "WORD":"ham",
  "IPA":"/hæm/",
  "CONJUGATES":"noun: ham | hams | verb: ham | hams | hamming | hammed",
  "ETYMOLOGY":"From Old English 'hamm' meaning 'hollow or bend of the knee', also 'hock of a hog'. Related to Old High German 'hamma' ('back of the knee') and Dutch 'ham' ('thigh, ham'). The culinary sense developed from this, referring to the cured thigh of a hog. The sense of 'overacting' comes from 'ham-actor' (1870s), possibly from 'hamfatter' which was a minstrel song and implies low quality or exaggerated performance. The 'amateur radio' sense is from the early 20th century, of uncertain origin but possibly derogatory initially.",
  "SINCE":"Before 900 AD (for the meat/anatomical sense), early 20th century (for overacting/radio senses)",
