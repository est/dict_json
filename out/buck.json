  "ETYMOLOGY":"From Old English bucca 'male goat', of Germanic origin. The sense of 'male deer' developed around the 14th century. The verb sense (to rear up) derives from the animal's behavior. The slang sense for 'dollar' is thought to be an abbreviation of buckskin (used historically for trade) or an earlier use of buck meaning 'a monetary stake' (mid-19th century, US).",
