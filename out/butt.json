  "IPA":"/bʌt/",
  "CONJUGATES":"butts (n. plural) | butts (v. 3rd person singular present) | butting (v. present participle) | butted (v. past simple, past participle)",
  "ETYMOLOGY":"Derived from multiple origins. The sense of 'end of something' and 'target' comes from Old French 'but' (target, goal), of Germanic origin. The sense of 'strike with the head' comes from Old French 'bouter' (to thrust, push). The sense of 'large barrel' comes from Old French 'botte' (cask), from Late Latin 'buttis'. The sense of 'rear end' is likely a shortening of 'buttocks' or an extension of the 'end of something' meaning.",
