  "ETYMOLOGY":"From Old French courber 'to bend, to curb', and also from Old French courbe 'a bent object, curve', both ultimately from Latin curvus 'bent, crooked'. The sense of 'restraint' (initially for horses) developed from the noun, leading to the verb 'to control or limit'. The meaning 'edge of a pavement' emerged in American English in the late 18th century, likely from the idea of a defined border.",
